## Requirements

**General:**

- Basic knowledge of Ansible, below are some links to the Ansible documentation to help get started if you are unfamiliar with Ansible
  - [Main Ansible documentation page](https://docs.ansible.com)
  - [Ansible Getting Started](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/intro_getting_started.html)

  - [Ansible Community Info](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/community/index.html)
- Functioning Ansible and/or Tower Installed, configured, and running. This includes all of the base Ansible/Tower configurations, needed packages installed, and infrastructure setup.
- Please read through the tasks in this role to gain an understanding of what each control is doing. Some of the tasks are disruptive and can have unintended consiquences in a live production system. Also familiarize yourself with the variables in the defaults/main.yml file or the [Main Variables Wiki Page](https://github.com/ansible-lockdown/Windows-2022-CIS/wiki/Main-Variables).

**Technical Dependencies:**

- Running Ansible/Tower setup (this role is tested against Ansible version 2.9.1 and newer)

The following packages must be installed on the controlling host/host where ansible is executed:

- passlib (or python2-passlib, if using python2)
- python-lxml
- python-xmltodict
- python-jmespath
- pywinrm or pypsrp

Package 'python-xmltodict' is required if you enable the OpenSCAP tool installation and run a report. Packages python(2)-passlib and python-jmespath are required for tasks with custom filters or modules. These are all required on the controller host that executes Ansible.

## Role Variables

This role is designed that the end user should not have to edit the tasks themselves. All customizing should be done via the defaults/main.yml file or with extra vars within the project, job, workflow, etc. These variables can be found [here](https://github.com/ansible-lockdown/Windows-2022-CIS/wiki/Main-Variables) in the Main Variables Wiki page. All variables are listed there along with descriptions.
